The [bot](https://t.me/change_toothbrush_bot) that allows you to schedule your recurring tasks and get notified about it beforehand!

## üîÆ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Installing

Python version (minimal) required: `3.8`   
It's recommended to use `venv` or `virtualenv` for better isolation.  

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Install the requirements:  
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```


Put all necessary parameters into **.env** file.  
There is an example **.env.default**.  
At least your telegram token should be present as variable for correct work.

```
TELEGRAM_TOKEN = 'your token'
```

## ‚òÑÔ∏è Running the tests and checking the codestyle

To run the tests:
```
pytest tests/
```

To verify that the code adheres to the project conventions:
```
make lint
```
That will run `black`, `isort` and `flake` checks.

## ü§ñ Usage

Local usage is pretty simple - just run from the root directory
```
python3.8 src/bot.py
```

Instruction for translating messages:
```
# Step 1: extract texts
pybabel extract --input-dirs=src/ --output=locale/change-toothbrush-bot.pot --project=change-toothbrush-bot
 
# Step 2: create *.po files. E.g. create en, ru, uk locales.
pybabel init --locale=ru_RU --input-file=locale/change-toothbrush-bot.pot --output-dir=locale 
 
# Step 3: translate texts located in locale/{language}/LC_MESSAGES/*.po
 
# Step 4: compile translations
pybabel compile --directory=locale --statistics
 
# Step 5: When you change the code of your bot you need to update po & mo files.
#     Step 5.1: regenerate pot file:
          pybabel extract --input-dirs=src/ --output=locale/change-toothbrush-bot.pot --project=change-toothbrush-bot
#     Step 5.2: update po files
          pybabel update --output-dir=locale --input-file=locale/change-toothbrush-bot.pot
#     Step 5.3: update your translations (location and tools you know from step 3)
#     Step 5.4: compile mo files
          pybabel compile --directory=locale --statistics
```

You may take a look at [Makefile](Makefile) to get some insight about the usage.

## üö¢ Deploy with Dokku (DO-based)

Assuming you have set up everything on Digital Ocean: 

### On Dokku machine:
1. Create an application (in Dokku terms).  
Make sure you've picked up an appropriate name to have it as a subdomain.
```
dokku apps:create [app_name]
```

2. Make sure Dokku knows about your main domain and add subdomain for the app. 
```
dokku domains:set-global [your.main.domain]
dokku domains:set [app_name] [app_name].[your.main.domain]
```

3. Set up config variables to be able to run the bot.  
In case you're migrating from Heroku - run `heroku config` and adjust an output.

```
dokku config:set [app_name] APPLICATION_NAME=[app_name]
dokku config:set [app_name] DOMAIN_NAME=[your.main.domain]
dokku config:set [app_name] TELEGRAM_TOKEN=""
dokku config:set [app_name] SENTRY_DSN=""
```

4. Upload certificates to the server (if you have your own and don't want to use LetsEncrypt). Do it somewhere in the directory of your application: `/home/dokku/[app_name]/`

```
# mkdir certs && cd certs/
touch [app_name].crt
# open a file and copy-paste the first Certificate

touch [app_name].key
# open a file and copy-paste the second Private Key

# You will need to create a .tar archive with these files and make Dokku know about it. 
tar -cvf cert-key.tar [app_name].key [app_name].crt
dokku certs:add [app_name] < cert-key.tar

# Check that everything is correct
dokku certs:report [app_name]
```

5. In case you need a database (you probably need) - install Postgres plugin and link DB with the app. 
```
sudo dokku plugin:install https://github.com/dokku/dokku-postgres.git

dokku postgres:create [app_name]-db
dokku postgres:link [app_name]-db [app_name]
```

### On your local machine

The only thing you need to do - add another remote to be able to push the code there.

```
git remote add dokku dokku@[your.server.ip.address]:[app_name]
```
Then you should be able to deploy your app just by typing
```
git push dokku master:master
```

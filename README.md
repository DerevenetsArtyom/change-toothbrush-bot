# Change Toothbrush Bot - never forget to update things

The [bot](https://t.me/change_toothbrush_bot) that allows you to schedule your recurring tasks and get notified about it beforehand!

## 🔮 Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Installing

Python version (minimal) required: `3.8`   
It's recommended to use `venv` or `virtualenv` for better isolation.  

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Install the requirements:  
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


Put all necessary parameters into **.env** file.  
There is an example **.env.default**.  
At least your telegram token should be present as variable for correct work.

```
TELEGRAM_TOKEN = 'your token'
```

## ☄️ Running the tests and checking the codestyle

To run the tests:
```
pytest tests/
```

To verify that the code adheres to the project conventions:
```
make lint
```
That will run `black`, `isort` and `flake` checks.

## 🤖 Usage

Local usage is pretty simple - just run from the root directory
```
python3.8 src/bot.py
```

You may take a look at [Makefile](Makefile) to get some insight about the usage.
